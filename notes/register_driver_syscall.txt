===The Register Driver System Call===

The RegisterDriver syscall is used by applications to announce to the OS that they are drivers, this makes certain additional syscalls available, while restricting other syscalls.

The parameters are:
	- The driver name
	- Driver function flags
	- Number of interrupts desired

Returns:
	- On success returns a file descriptor to a pipe that allows the driver to receive messages from the kernel

	- On failure (driver status has already been locked out) return EPERM

Notes:
	- This syscall may only be called once, subsequent calls will return ENOSYS
